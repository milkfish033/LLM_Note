# 1. Introduction to Machine Learning Algorithms
## 1. Supervised learning
Given input denoted as x, predict output y. 
Note: in supervised learning, training data is labelized, i.e. correct answer is given 

Two main kinds of supervised learning :

- Regression: predict **a number** from **infinitely many number**
- Classfication: predict categories **small number** of possible outputs, e.g. 0 or 1



## 2. Unsupervised
Find a specific pattern/something interesting among unlabled data

E.g. Clustering, Anormaly detection (Find unusual data points), Dimensionality reduction (Compress data using fewer data)

## 3. Recommender system
A machine learning system that **suggests items** to users based on behavior, preferences, or similarities.

Examples:
- Movie recommendations (Netflix)  
- Shopping suggestions (Amazon)  
- Music recommendations (Spotify)

Common approaches:
- **Content-based filtering:** recommend items similar to what the user previously liked  
- **Collaborative filtering:** recommend items liked by **similar users**

## 4. Reinforcement learning
A learning paradigm where an **agent** interacts with an **environment**, takes actions, and learns through **trial and error** using **rewards** and **penalties**.

Key ideas:
- Agent chooses actions  
- Environment returns reward  
- Agent learns a policy that **maximizes long-term total reward**
